Subcommand: ops util

Usage: 
    config <configjson>

Description:
Prompt the user for configuration data defined in the config.json file. 
From the input config, the script will remove the keys that are already set in ops,
and only prompt the user for the missing data. Then they will be saved in the ops config.

The config.json file must be a JSON file with the following structure:
      
  {
    "KEY": {
      type: "string"
    },
    "OTHER_KEY": {
      type: "int"
    },
    ...
  }

The keys must be uppercase words (separated by underscores).
The value for the "type" key must be either string with the following values:
- string
- int
- float
- bool
- password

or an array of strings with specific values (an enum).
